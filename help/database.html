      OpenFlights airport searches can use three databases.
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>OpenFlights</b> is the default database, created by merging GAD and DAFIF and manually correcting countless errors.  <i>Only airports found in OpenFlights searches can be used to enter your flights.</i>

	<li><b>DAFIF</b> is the October 2006 cycle of the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File managed by the United States <a href="http://www.nga.mil/">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</a>.  The accuracy of DAFIF data is very high, but it does not include city names or IATA codes.  (However, it does include FAA codes for US airports.)  Unfortunately, DAFIF data after October 2006 is no longer available to the public.  Data from DAFIF can be preloaded into the search form for easy adding to the OpenFlights DB.
	  
	<li><b>Global Airport Database</b> (v0.0.1) is a public domain database by <a href="http://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/">Arash Partow</a>.  It contains city names and IATA codes, but is woefully out of date, with many entries in wrong/obsolete countries, obsolete ICAO codes and lat/lon information missing for many cities.
      </ul>
