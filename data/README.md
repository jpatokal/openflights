This directory contains snapshots of the OpenFlights airport, airline and route databases.

Please see [Data](https://openflights.org/data.php) for file format, licensing, and more.

Since these files are only snapshots of live data, **pull requests are not accepted**.

Please create an account on [OpenFlights.org](https://openflights.org) and submit your edit using the airport editor, or [open an issue](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/issues) if there is a systemic problem (eg. wrong timezone for an entire country).
