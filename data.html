        <p>The data is UTF-8 encoded. The special value <b>\N</b> is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.</p>
        <p><i>Notes</i>: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines. Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included. For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.</p>

        <h2>Plane database</h2>

        <p>The OpenFlights plane database contains a curated selection of <b>173</b> passenger aircraft with IATA and/or ICAO codes, covering the
        vast majority of flights operated today and commonly used in flight schedules and reservation systems. Each entry contains the following information:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
              <td class="head">Name</td>
              <td class="data">Full name of the aircraft.
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="head">IATA code</td>
              <td class="data">Unique three-letter IATA identifier for the aircraft.
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="head">ICAO code</td>
              <td class="data">Unique four-letter ICAO identifier for the aircraft.
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The data is UTF-8 encoded. The special value <b>\N</b> is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.</p>

        <i>Notes</i>:
        <ul>
          <li>Aircraft with IATA but without ICAO codes are generally aircraft classes: for example, IATA "747" can be any type of Boeing 747, whereas
            IATA "744"/ICAO "B744" is specifically a Boeing 747-400.
        </ul>

        <h4>Sample entries</h4>

"Boeing 787-10","78J","B78X"

        <h2>Country database</h2>

        <p>The OpenFlights country database contains a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1 country codes</a>,
            which can be used to look up the human-readable country names for the codes used in the Airline and Airport tables. Each entry contains the following information:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
              <td class="head">name</td>
              <td class="data">Full name of the country or territory.

        <i>Notes</i>:
        <ul>
          <li>Some entries have DAFIF codes, but not ISO codes. These are primarily uninhabited islands without airports, and can be ignored for
            most purposes.
