	    <p>The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded.  The special value <b>\N</b> is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.</p>
	    <p><i>Notes</i>: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines.  Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included.  For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.</p>
