	    <p>As of February 2009, the OpenFlights Airports Database contains <b>4381</b> airports spanning the globe as shown above.  Each entry contains the following information:</p>

	    <table>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Name</td>
		  <td class="data">Name of airport.  May or may not contain the <b>City</b> name.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">City</td>
		  <td class="data">Main city served by airport.  May be spelled differently from <b>Name</b>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Country</td>
		  <td class="data">Country or territory where airport is located.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">IATA/FAA</td>
		  <td class="data">3-letter FAA code, for airports located in <b>Country</b> "United States of America".<br>
		    3-letter IATA code, for all other airports.<br>
		    Blank if not assigned.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">ICAO</td>
		  <td class="data">4-letter ICAO code.<br>
		    Blank if not assigned.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Longitude</td>
		  <td class="data">Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits.  Negative is West, positive is East.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Latitude</td>
		  <td class="data">Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits.  Negative is South, positive is North.</td>

		  <td class="data">In feet.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Timezone</td>
		  <td class="data">Hours offset from UTC.  Fractional hours are expressed as decimals, eg. India is 5.5.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">DST</td>
		  <td class="data">Daylight savings time.  One of E (Europe), A (US/Canada), S (South America), O (Australia), Z (New Zealand), N (None) or U (Unknown). <i>See also: <a target="_blank" href="help/time.html">Help: Time</i></p>

		</tr>
	      </tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>The data is ASCII-encoded, with no special characters.</p>

	    <p><i>Note</i>: Rules for daylight savings time change from year to year and from country to country.  The current data is an approximation for 2009, built on a country level.  Most airports in DST-less regions in countries that generally observe DST (eg. AL, HI in the USA, NT, QL in Australia, parts of Canada) are marked incorrectly.</p>

	    <p>Creating and maintaining this database has required and continues to require an <i>immense amount</i> of work, which is why it would cost you <i>over one thousand dollars</i> to buy it from a commercial supplier.  We need your support to keep this database up-to-date: just click on the PayPal link to the right (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover also accepted).  We suggest <b>US$50</b>, but any amount at all is welcome, and you may use the data for free if you feel that you are unable to pay.  If you do donate, please specify in the comments if you would like a itemized receipt for business expense or tax purposes.</p>

	    <h2>Airline database</h2>

	    <p>As of February 2009, the OpenFlights Airlines Database contains <b>5971</b> airlines.  Each entry contains the following information:</p>

	    <table>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Name</td>
		  <td class="data">Name of the airline.
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Alias</td>
		  <td class="data">Alias of the airline.  For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA". </td>

		<tr>
		  <td class="head">ICAO</td>

		  <td class="data">Airline callsign.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td class="head">Country</td>
		  <td class="data">Country or territory where airline is incorporated.</td>
		</tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded.  The special value <b>\N</b> is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.</p>
	    <p><i>Notes</i>: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines.  Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included.  For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.</p>

	    <h4>Sample entries</h4>
	    <pre>"All Nippon Airways","ANA All Nippon Airways","NH","ANA","ALL NIPPON","Japan"
"All Star Airlines",\N,"","ASR"," Inc.","ALL STAR"

	    <p>Airport base data was generated by mashing together DAFIF (October 2006 cycle) for location, ICAO data and country data with the Global Airport Database for IATA codes and city names, plus timezone information from <a href="http://www.earthtools.org">EarthTools</a>.  All DST information added manually.  Significant revisions and additions made by the users of OpenFlights.</p>

	    <p>Airline data was extracted directly from Wikipedia's gargantuan <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/en/List_of_airlines">List of airlines</a>.  Significant revisions and additions made by the users of OpenFlights.</p>
