"In a nutshell, it's a tool that lets you <b>map</b> your flights around the "
"world, <b>search and filter</b> them in all sorts of interesting ways, "
"calculate <b>statistics</b> automatically, and <b>share</b> the resulting "
"maps with friends and the world. You can also check <b>airport route maps</"
"b> for nearly every airport in the world and find out <b>what airlines fly "

msgid "Why is OpenFlights better than other similar services?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, as far as we know, there actually isn't anything <i>quite</i> like "
"OpenFlights out there, but here are some things that separate us from the "
"putative competition:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenFlights has a <b>dynamic map</b>. You can pan, zoom, select, scroll and "
"explore all you like!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenFlights is <b>user-friendly and efficient</b>. Everything's on the same "
"page!"
msgstr ""

msgid "OpenFlights <b>makes searching really easy</b>. Point and click!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenFlights has a <b>powerful filter</b>. Three clicks, and your map will "
"show only Singapore Airlines flights in business class in 2007."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenFlights <b>works in realtime</b>. Make any change, and you'll see it "
"right then and there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenFlights supports <b>\"trips\"</b> (<a href=\"/help/trip.php\">read more</"
"a>). You can join up any flights together into a trip, which you can then "
"display on its own page and even share with friends."
msgstr ""

msgid "How much does it cost?"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Why aren't the flight paths smoothly curved, especially up near the poles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That would be hard to draw fast, so we cheat and chop them up, one segment "
"per every 500 mi. Flights under 1000 mi are shown as straight lines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The distances for the statistics, though, are calculated correctly as <a "
"href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance\">great circle "
"distances</a>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Are those flight time estimates accurate? Can I enter my own?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The site currently uses a really fancy formula to calculate them: \"30 min "

msgstr ""

"looking for a decommissioned airport, you may need to use the ICAO code "
"instead of the IATA code. For example, ATH points to Athens-Eleftherios "
"Venizelos (LGAV), but you can still find Athens-Ellinikon as LGAT. If the "
"main OpenFlights DB doesn't have it, try a search in the OurAirports "
"database with the airport's name or ICAO code. If you find it in "
"OurAirports, click <input type=\"button\" value=\"Load\" align=\"middle\"> "

"While the system does not <i>officially</i> support being logged in as the "

"cause problems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something went wrong when I imported from FlightMemory!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This most often happens with airlines, since FlightMemory and OpenFlights do "
"not render all company names in the same way. OpenFlights also uses current "
"airline data, not historical, so e.g. SN123 will be mapped to \"Brussels "
"Airlines\", not \"Sabena\". To keep the old airline names exactly the way "
"you had them on FlightMemory, check <b>Keep historical airline names?</b> "
"when importing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The other common source of headaches is unofficial airports like heliports "
"and landing strips, which do not have IATA/ICAO codes. These have to be "
"entered manually into OpenFlights using \"Add new airport\" <i>before</i> "
"you can import. Note that the matching is done based on the <i>first word of "
"the airport name</i>, so make sure the one in your data matches the one you "
"enter exactly."
msgstr ""

"If anything else goes wrong during importing, or if a current airline is "
